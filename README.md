Hey there, I'm Sociopathix, also known as Andi from Shoerstack Games!

I'm not super well-versed with git but it's useful, so I use it when needed. I really enjoy programming, especially game development related programs, but also others.
I work mostly with GDScript, a language similar to Python 3 from the Godot game engine, but I also occasionally work with C# and Java.

I'm a twenty year old university student looking to gain more experience and work ethic in what I love doing. Hopefully, however, soon I'll be done with this chapter of my life
so I can move on to other projects and ideas that interest and impassion me!
